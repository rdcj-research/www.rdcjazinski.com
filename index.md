**Researcher | Inquirer | Systems Thinker**

With a background in technology, media, computation, and epistemology, my work moves across disciplines to explore how form, [resonance](https://www.symbolicresonance.com), and [symbolic logic](https://www.symbolicresonance.com) shape the way we think, decide, and build.

Over the past 25 years, [I’ve worked in software development, systems architecture, strategic product design, interactive media, and leadership advisory](https://www.rodrigojazinski.com) — often navigating the space between engineering and intuition. In parallel, I’ve pursued a long-standing exploration of knowledge systems, symbolic structures, and the deeper harmonics that guide human cognition.

This ongoing research is not confined to a thesis or institution. It is a personal and recursive process of seeing the underlying shape of things — and learning how to hold complexity without collapsing it.
