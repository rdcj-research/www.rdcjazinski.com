Independent researcher. Systems-oriented thinker. Symbolic scientist.

With a background in technology, media, computation, and epistemology, my work moves across disciplines to explore how form, resonance, and symbolic logic shape the way we think, decide, and build.

Over the past 25 years, I’ve worked in software development, systems architecture, strategic product design, interactive media, and leadership advisory — often navigating the space between engineering and intuition. In parallel, I’ve pursued a long-standing exploration of knowledge systems, symbolic structures, and the deeper harmonics that guide human cognition.

This ongoing research is not confined to a thesis or institution. It is a personal and recursive process of seeing the underlying shape of things — and learning how to hold complexity without collapsing it.
